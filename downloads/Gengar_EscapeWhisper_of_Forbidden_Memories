Game: "Gengar Escape: Whisper of Forbidden Memories"

Story:
Gengar was once the favorite and main Pokémon of his trainer, Sekmuxib. The two shared countless battles, victories, and an unbreakable bond. To Gengar, Sekmuxib was more than just a trainer — he was a true partner and friend.

One day, during a wild encounter with a powerful Pokémon — Dragapult, one of the most fearsome Ghost-types — Sekmuxib used Gengar in a tough battle to capture it. They succeeded, but what followed was unexpected. Gradually, Dragapult became Sekmuxib’s new favorite. Gengar, once the center of his trainer’s attention, began to feel ignored… forgotten.

Out of jealousy and heartbreak, Gengar confronted Dragapult one day while Sekmuxib was away. In a brutal surprise attack, he tried to defeat the new favorite — but failed. When Sekmuxib found out about the incident, he was furious. Feeling betrayed, he made a cruel decision: to abandon Gengar.

There was an old, mysterious castle on the edge of Lavender Town, known in whispered legends as "The Whispers of Forbidden Memories." Locals believed it to be cursed — a place where the souls of dead and abandoned Pokémon lingered. According to myth, within its decaying halls lived ghostly spirits known as the Whisperers, who would fill the ears of forsaken Pokémon with hateful and poisonous thoughts. These whispers grew inside their victims, turning sorrow into rage, and pain into fury — until they could no longer leave. The castle became their home, and their prison.

Sekmuxib, who never believed in these tales, took Gengar to the castle and left him there — promising to return, though he had no intention of keeping that promise.

Gengar waited.

Days turned into months. Months into years.

The once playful, jolly Gengar began to wither emotionally — becoming sorrowful, broken, and angry. The Whisperers were real. They spoke to Gengar endlessly, fueling his misery with lies and painful truths alike. His sorrow slowly transformed into wrath.

Within the castle, a powerful stone known as Gengarite began to appear. The Whisperers told Gengar that collecting enough of it would allow him to evolve into Mega Gengar — something even stronger, something unstoppable. But this time, Gengar had no interest in evolution for power’s sake.

Fueled by years of abandonment and betrayal, he made a decision: he would collect the Gengarite and escape the castle — not to find his trainer, but to take revenge.

But to do so, he must face a maze of traps, puzzles, and enemies — all manifestations of his own subconscious. The castle, feeding off his tortured mind, has turned his darkest thoughts into the very obstacles he must overcome.

Gengar sets off, determined to break free.

what shock awaits him in the outside world.
