Project Title: Snake Adventure (Game)

Description: It is similar to endless runner game, where the protagonist is a snake who 
keeps crawling avoiding obstacles. There will be no levels. The snake is shown on the
screen moving along the ground, from left to right on the screen, and the background will
be shown seemingly moving backwards. The player can move the snake vertically, simply by pressing the 
up and down arrow keys, which makes the snake to crawl on the other path. In this way, the
snake can avoid obstacles. There will be multiple paths for changing the lane for crawling. 
There will be healthpoints, and it will reduce by one on confronting the obstacle. But if 
the snake faces a death trap, then it will be game over (the whole healthpoint will be lost).
The players can also collect one healthpoint to restore the health, however it will spawn
less. They can also collect the sheild power which protects them from obstacles and will
last for few moments.

The scoring will be made based on the crossed distance and the collected points(collected 
points will be shown as fruits or coins). There is also an arrangement for leaderboard 
for keeping the highest record. The player has two themes to choose for playing: 
							 1. Forest Theme
							 2. Desert Theme
In the forest theme, the snake will be shown moving on the ground in the jungle, leaves will
be shown scattered on the ground. The obstacles include stones, wooden logs, spike plant,
hunter traps and so on. The death trap will be shown on the ground as the red cross sign. 
It indicates the target of the eagle. The snake will be attacked by the eagle, if it crosses
that red cross sign and the game will be over. 

In the desert theme, the player can move the snake on the sand. Cactus, stones etc will be 
usual obstacles. The death trap will be the hunter trap and the functionality will be
same.
