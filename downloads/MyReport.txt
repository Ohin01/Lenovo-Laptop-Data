Twinforge Inferno:

This is the first trap room of the main game. In this game-level, Gengar confronts with the guilt, one of the dark feelings, disguised as Dark Gengar. The 
goal is to kill the Dark Gengar and get out of the lava room within a specific time. The features of this level are described below:

GridWise Mapping:
This level is made on a 11X11 grid-system,implemented using 2D array. Every type of tile(e. stone tile, magma tile, switch) is represented by their corresponding number in the array. 

Mirror Movement of the characters:
There are two characters: Gengar and Dark Gengar. Each character is characterized by position, velocity, visibility and health. Their gridwise movement is
controlled via keyboard (WSAD or arrows) with the mirror movement of the Dark Gengar.

Randomizing switch and position of the door:
rand() and srand() are used for generating random sequences of button number of switches. This is also done for the spawning of the door at random position. 

Active and inactive switch:
The change of random inactive switch to active swtch in the grid-system is handled here.

Magma pop-up and Door pop-up:
They dissappear after a specific time and again show up when triggered.

Collectables:
There are 10 firestones in this game. Gengar have to collect these items. The dissappearing of the firestones after being collected by Gengar is handled by grid manupulation and
rendering.

Collsion:
The collision between characters and falling of characters into lava are handled in this level.
