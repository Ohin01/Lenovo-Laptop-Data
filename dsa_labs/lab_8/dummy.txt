The Paradox of Choice is a psychological observation popularized by American psychologist Barry Schwartz in his 2004 book, which argues that while autonomy and freedom of choice are critical to human well-being, an abundance of options actually leads to negative emotional outcomes rather than positive ones. The central thesis contradicts the deep-seated dogma of modern western societies that maximizing freedom requires maximizing choice; instead, Schwartz suggests that eliminating choices can greatly reduce anxiety for shoppers and citizens. To illustrate this, researchers Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper conducted a famous study involving jam at an upscale grocery store, where they set up two display tables: one featuring a limited selection of six jams and another featuring an extensive selection of twenty-four jams. 
While the table with twenty-four jams attracted significantly more interest from passersby, the table with only six jams resulted in ten times more actual sales, demonstrating that when the human brain is confronted with an overwhelming array of variables, it often shuts down or defaults to inaction to avoid the mental burden of processing so much information, a state known as analysis paralysis. 
Beyond the issue of mere paralysis, the paradox suggests that even when a decision is finally made from a massive pool of options, the chooser is less satisfied with their decision than they would have been had they chosen from a smaller pool. This dissatisfaction stems from the concept of opportunity cost, where the attractive features of the rejected alternatives linger in the mind, subtracting from the satisfaction derived from the chosen item. For instance, if you buy a pair of jeans from a store that offers only one style, you judge the jeans on their own merits; however, if you buy a pair from a store offering fifty different cuts and washes, and the fit isn't absolutely perfect, you immediately imagine that one of the other forty-nine pairs would have been better, leading to self-blame and regret. 
Furthermore, an abundance of choice escalates expectations to unrealistic levels because, with so many options available, we logically assume that a perfect option must exist, and anything less than perfection feels like a failure of discernment on our part. This creates a cycle where we are objectively doing better but feeling subjectively worse, constantly haunted by the "what ifs" of the roads not taken. Ultimately, the theory divides people into "maximizers," who exhaustively seek the absolute best option and often suffer from higher anxiety and regret, and "satisficers," who settle for an option that is merely good enough and generally report higher levels of happiness. 
In a world characterized by an explosion of variety—from the hundreds of salad dressing options in supermarkets to the thousands of shows on streaming platforms—understanding the Paradox of Choice serves as a reminder that voluntarily restricting our own options and embracing "good enough" may be the key to reclaiming our peace of mind and escaping the tyranny of unlimited selection.
